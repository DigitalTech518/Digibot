# Digibot 
### Open source discord bot project! Using the project to learn python, and coding as a whole!
##### Leave suggestions for commands as a issue! (avoid duplicates please)

Digibot is a utility, logging, multipurpose bot that has commands that allow for all sorts of things! From reminders, to time, to even just simple warnings!

Utility: There is only a few of these commands at the moment, but aiming for a lot more in the future! These range from commands like time, which lets you find out another user’s time if they have set their time, reminders, which let you set a reminder for later, and you’ll receive a dm with the reminder or a ping from the channel if dms are closed, join roles, which lets you set a role for when someone joins, and reaction roles, which lets you set certain reactions to give users a role! You can also have a notepad!! Using commands like notepad, notes, and deletenote, you can view, delete, and add new notes and add to existing notes!

Bot: The bot itself has many commands revolving around it. These range from commands like ping, which finds the ping of the bot, enable/disabling commands, which can disable or enable a command server wide, stats, which you can see which commands are used the most, and prefix, which lets you change the prefix of the bot for the server!

Music: The brand new music commands have a few options! Use the play command to play any song on YouTube! Also use commands like queue, skip, stop, leave and etc., to enchant your music playing time! Commands like skip, stop, leave, pause all use a voting system when there is more than 2 people in the vc, in order to prevent anyone from coming in and ruining your tunes! (if you don't like this use support command to contact me about it please!)

Fun: There is only a few of these simple commands, but use these for gifs (mostly) like butterdog, yikes, shut, or unfunny! The bot also has a command called 8ball, which you can ask any yes or no question, and it will reply with nothing but the Truth! And for moderators! There is command called bean, where you get to bean any user (a joke ban) for any reason!

Moderation: The bot includes a multitude of moderation commands. Ranging from simple banning of a user, to muting a user temporarily, to even warning a user for breaking the rules! You also can use a command called mutedrole, which does all the work for you by making a muted role and setting ALL the channel permissions needed!
